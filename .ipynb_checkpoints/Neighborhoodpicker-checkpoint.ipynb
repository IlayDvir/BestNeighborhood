    "# Best Neighborhood in Pittsburgh\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our mission to find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh is based fundamentally on living standard. This concept is wide ranging and can depend on many things, such as the economy, health care, and education. Since we are limited to using datasets provided on the WPRDC website, we decided to find datasets which reflect some aspect to standard of living which also is measured according to neighborhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets and metrics \n",
    "Our datasets include educational attainment, household income, and housing unit value. These datasets were all taken from the same survey, so their structure is similar, and they contain all of the same neighborhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Educational Attainment can be a good indicator of standard of living. Access to higher education is seen as a pillar of developement and standard of living in a developed country. This also usually correlates with other factors that lead to higher standards of living, such as higher income, which in turn leads to better access to healthcare and nutrion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Household income over a 12 month period is a straightforward indicator of standard of living. We may not like it, but having access to money provides access to many other important things in life, such as healthcare, education, food, housing, and other recreational activities that are important to people's mental health. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Housing Unit Values per neighborhood gives us a metric in which we can determine the housing prices in the neighborhood. In most scenarios, neighboorhoods with a higher housing price means that it is a safer, more wealthy neighboorhood. There is usually a direct relationship between Housing prices and crime, public services, etc. By choosing to use Housing Unit Values, we are able to combine lots of factors that make a neighborhood together.\n"

    "### Educational Attainment \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset shows the level of education for each neighborhood in Pittsburgh. The ranges are broken down by grade level, and then degree attainment according to the highest level the person achieved. Our metric is measuring the proportion of the population of the neighborhood that has a Bachelor's Degree or higher. This is an arbitrary but understandable milestone to judge the level of education. We are making the assumption that a population with higher levels of education also has a higher standard of living, because they have more opportunities to get higher paying jobs."

We can measure the level of affluence of a neighborhood by looking at the number of households that make more than $100,000 in income. This is an arbitrary standard, but one which many americans seem to see as a significant milestone. We can then take the ratio of households with over 100K compared to all households in the neighborhood and then compare the ratios between neighborhoods to try to nullify population differences between neighborhoods. \n"

    "In conclusion, using these datasets and metrics we can see that a few neighborhoods are at the top of all of these charts, such as Squirell Hill, Regent Square, and Point Breeze. This aligns with our own experience living in Pittsburgh. These neighborhoods have nice and expensive houses, the people who live there are educated and wealthier, there is less crime as a result, and they are generally kept clean. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some potential downsides to our data analytics is that the datasets all came from the same large survey in 2015. This is almost 10 years ago. We thought it was still appropriate to use this data, because even though the economy has changed since then, the relative relationships between neighborhoods likely has not. For example, housing prices have gone up since then, but I expect that the houses in Squirrel Hill have gone up approximately at the same rate as houses in Oakland, so they may both be higher numbers, but their relative values are about the same.
