    "# Best Neighborhood in Pittsburgh\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our mission to find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh is based fundamentally on living standard. This concept is wide ranging and can depend on many things, such as the economy, health care, and education. Since we are limited to using datasets provided on the WPRDC website, we decided to find datasets which reflect some aspect to standard of living which also is measured according to neighborhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets and metrics \n",
    "Our datasets include arrest data by neighborhood, median age of death by neighborhood, and fire incidents (?)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Arrest incidents show where the arrest was made. This can reflect the level of crime in the neighborhood. This is not a perfect indication, because of course there are crimes that go unreported and the criminals are never arrested. That being said, if there is a significantly higher number of arrests in one neighborhood compared to another, this is probably an indicator of the level of public safety in the area and maybe a symptom of other socioeconomic issues that are pervasive in that neighborhood. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Housing Unit Values per neighborhood gives us a metric in which we can determine the housing prices in the nieghborhood. In most case scenarios, neighboorhoods with a higher housing price means that it is a safer, more wealthy neighboorhood. There is usually a direct relaitonship between Housing prices and crime, public services, etc. By choosing to use Housing Unit Values, we are able to combine lots of factors that make a neighborhood together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The median age of death in a neighborhood also can reflect standard of living. When comparing countries' level of development, life expectancy is an important factor. It generally depends on the healthcare, nutrion, and lifestyle in a society, and is commonly negatively influenced by instability and conflict. We can use this idea on a smaller scale when comparing neighborhoods in the city. If a neighborhood has a significantly lower median age of death, this can be reflective of a general lower standard of living due to socioeconomic issues.\n",

    "### Arrest data \n",
    "\n",
    "The arrest data lists an incident location and incident neighborhood. For this metric, we simply summed up the number of incidents per neighborhood. The higher the number, the worse a neighborhood it will be. The area size of a neighborhood, or the population could be factored in to consider proportionality too."
